"""Budget tracking and CRUD operations.

Provides BudgetTracker class for creating, reading, updating, and deleting budgets,
as well as tracking spending progress against budgeted amounts.

Generic Design:
- Works with any budget type (personal, household, business, project)
- Integrates with svc-infra SQL for persistence
- Integrates with fin-infra categorization for transaction mapping
- Supports rollover budgets (unused amounts carry over)
